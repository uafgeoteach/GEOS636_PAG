If these were your own data, they should be an [xarray](https://xarray.pydata.org/en/stable/generated/xarray.DataArray.html#xarray.DataArray) data type, or a string that points to a GMT-style [grd](https://docs.generic-mapping-tools.org/latest/gmt.html#grd-inout-full) file.\n",

You can also specify the location by handing 1d arrays to keywords `x` and `y`; this would allow to plot every symbol with a different size which can be specified via the `size` keywork. A popular example for this would be plotting earthquakes and scaling the symbol size by magnitude.\n",
