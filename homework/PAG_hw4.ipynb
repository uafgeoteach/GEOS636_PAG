    "Last week you wrote a few lines of Python code that iterate over a list of numbers to print out whether or not a number is divisible by 3. This week, you will generalize this into a function called `divisible_by` that takes in two values: the first parameter is the dividend, the second parameter is the divisor. The function returns one value: `True` if there's no remainder after the division, that is the dividend is divisible by the divsor, and `False` otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once this function is written, iterate over the list `to_test` from last week, given below, and test which values are divible by 5.\n"
