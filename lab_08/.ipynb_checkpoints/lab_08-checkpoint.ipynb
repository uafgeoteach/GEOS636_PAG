    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Unix and shell scripting are very useful tools that can work alongside your developing Python knowledge. In this lab you will exercise some of the commands we discussed in lecture, gain experience with using/understanding the help pages for other commands, and write some simple shell scripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your deliverable for this lab will be this notebook, with answers to questions completed as requested below. Please rename the notebook from `lab_08.ipynb` to `<last_name>_lab_08.ipynb` prior to submission. Download the completed file with **File $\\rightarrow$ Download**. Submit it to Canvas under the Lab 8 assignment.\n",

    "If you don't already have a terminal window up, you can start up a new one to use for this lab with **File $\\rightarrow$ New $\\rightarrow$ Terminal**.\n",

    "First, let's gather the files we'll be working with today. In a terminal window, enter\n",
    "```\n",
    "pwd\n",
    "```\n",
    "which will **p**rint the **w**orking **d**irectory. You should see\n",

    "/home/jovyan\n",
    "```\n",
    "as the output. (If you see anything else, type `cd`, which will move you to the above directory.)\n",
    "\n",
    "You can then move into this lab's directory (which is within `GEOS636_PAG`) with\n",
    "```\n",
    "cd GEOS636_PAG/lab_08\n",
    "```\n",
    "and you can view the files contained in this directory with\n",
    "```\n",
    "ls\n",
    "```\n",
    "You should see a few files (e.g., `file1`, `file2`) listed in the output. Now you're located in the correct directory with the correct files, and you can begin the lab.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Deliverable I: Unix command scavenger hunt <font color='red'>(25 points)</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the following commands to accomplish the tasks indicated:\n",

    "**(a)** `mkdir` — make a new directory called `tiny_snek`  \n",
    "**(b)** `touch` — create a new empty file in the `tiny_snek` directory - name is up to you  \n",
    "**(c)** `date` — print out the current date and time in seconds since 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC  \n",
    "**(d)** `cat` — put contents of `file1` and `file2` sequentially together into a new file `file3`  \n",
    "**(e)** `split` — break a 500-line file (`largefile.txt`) into multiple files that each have 50 lines  \n",
    "**(f)** `head` — print out the first 15 lines of the file `largefile2.txt`\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note that this exercise requires that you read the help documentation (or use Google)! To view the help for a command, use\n",
