For example, I (Ronni Grapenthin) would rename the notebook to `grapenthin_lab_01.ipynb`. You can do this by clicking on the filename in the top-left corner of this window (similar to e.g. Google Docs). Download the completed file by checking its box in the JupyterHub file browser and selecting **Download** from the menu that appears.

    "## **Part 1 — Jupyterhub @ OSL: A consistent computing environment for all**\n",
    "\n",
    "As you've gathered by now, this course is about programming. One important facet of programming is your \"computing environment\" — that is, the computer (or, in geek-speak, the \"machine\") you're programming on and what is installed on that machine. There are many flavors of computing environments, based on your machine's specifications, its operating system, and its age. This can make teaching a class on programming difficult.\n",
    "\n",
    "To circumvent this issue, we're using an online computing environment for PAG called jupyterhub which is part of the openSARlab cloud infrastructure that the Alaska Satellite Facility developed and maintains. Much of what we do will happen in [notebooks](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/stable/notebook.html) (a lot of useful info behind this link!), like this one. The code you write and execute within a \"notebook\" runs in the cloud — meaning on a server in a (in this case Amazon-owned) serverfarm somewhere. So even though it seems like you're running the code on your machine, it's really just your browser communicating with that server. This ensures that everyone has an identical experience — and it'll make all of our lives easier!"

    "A core part of programming is using tools. If you wrote everything \"from scratch\" every time you would spend way too much time programming. Instead you'll use tools that other people have already written to speed up the process, and eventually write tools yourself too! In the next cell we \"import\" two powerful sets of tools, making them available for use in all other cells of the notebook. In programming lingo these sets of tools are known as \"libraries\". The first library, matplotlib, allows you to easily generate plots and other graphics. The second library, numpy, has a lot of powerful routines to create and manipulate multi-dimensional arrays.

Go up to where we define `x` using [`np.arange()`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.arange.html) ane make the step size smaller until the curve is smooth. You'll have to rerun both code cells. Wondering which of the three parameters is the step size? Here is a useful trick you can do in a Jupyter Notebook - if you want to pull up the documentation for a function you are using you can type the name if the function followed by a question mark into a code cell and then execute the code cell. So in our case you would run \"np.arange?\". Make a new code cell and try that below.

There are several styles of project that a student could take on, depending on their needs. Flexibility in this regard is beneficial for the students, as they learn more by doing more, and do more when they are excited about and see the relevance of the project. The project must be implemented in code using one of the tools used in the class (or a different tool with instructor permission). The students must turn in complete code (ideally via inviting the instructors to their github repository), raw data files (if larger than 100MB contact instructor), etc, so that the instructor could run their code and replicate their results. Code must be adequately commented. **Sample projects include one of these, at a minimum: (a) reading in data and doing useful manipulation and visualization of the data; (b) constructing a coherent suite of scientific figures or visualizations of data; (c) developing and running a numerical model; (d) writing a program or programs to automate a task that must be done repeatedly (for example, a data processing or analysis task), and using this program to run a substantial amount of data.**\n",
