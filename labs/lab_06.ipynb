    "A proper understanding of how to get information into and out of your programs is essential for making them useful! This concept is often called \"I/O\" — short for \"input/output\" — and it encompasses reading in and writing files as well as printing information to the console for immediate viewing. In this lab, we will cover several types of I/O using Python's built-in `print()` function with string formatting as well as file I/O with NumPy and pandas.\n",

Please rename your ZIP file to `<last_name>_lab_06.zip` prior to submission. Submit your ZIP file to Canvas under the Lab 6 assignment no later than **midnight Thursday, October 7th**.\n",

    "This works because Python internally converts these objects to strings before displaying them. For more control, however, you'll want to format things into strings before printing them. You can do this using the [`format()` method](https://www.w3schools.com/python/ref_string_format.asp) of strings. This allows you to insert values into a string, as well as format those inserted values to your liking. You place open brackets `{}` where you want values to be inserted in the string; the values to be placed are provided as inputs to `format()`. This is useful if you want to print the value stored in a variable. Here are some examples:"
