    "A proper understanding of how to get information into and out of your programs is essential for making them useful! This concept is often called \"I/O\" — short for \"input/output\" — and it encompasses reading in and writing files as well as printing information to the console for immediate viewing. In this lab, we will cover several types of I/O using Python's built-in `print()` function with string formatting as well as file I/O with NumPy and pandas.\n",

    "**New this week:** For 636 students your deliverable for this lab will be a ZIP file containing this notebook and an additional file for deliverable 3 as requested below. Please rename your ZIP file to `<last_name>_lab_06.zip` prior to submission. Submit your ZIP file to Canvas under the Lab 6 assignment. For 436 students your submission remains the same as previous weeks - just the renamed notebook.\n",
