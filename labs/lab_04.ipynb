    "\n",
    "This week we're going to learn about dictionaries and functions in Python. However, before we delve into this topic, we're going to do a refresher exercise on lists and iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your deliverable for this lab will be this notebook, with **\"deliverables\" completed as requested below**. The \"exercises\" are exploratory and not graded. Please rename the notebook from `lab_04.ipynb` to `<last_name>_lab_04.ipynb` prior to submission. Download the file using **File $\\rightarrow$ Download**. Submit it to Canvas under the Lab 4 assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please note that Deliverable 4 is only required for students enrolled in 636. Students in 436 are welcome to complete the deliverable and will be given feedback on their work if they do, but it will not factor into their grade.\n",

    "We're going to combine everything that we learned and add something extra. We will be using the [`open()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#open) function to open a data file consisting of latitudes, longitudes and station names. `open()` returns a \"file object\" which provides several operations that can operate on this datatype. We will use the `read()` function, which returns the entire file contents in one single string (if called without a parameter). String objects provide another [set of functions](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods). Here, we'll use the `split()` function to split the single string that contains all of the file contents into a list of strings using any whitespace (spaces, tabs, newlines) as a separator.\n",

Second, lists are indexed by numbers and dictionaries are indexed with keys. Dictionary keys can be any string or number or more complex datatypes such as datetime objects.

    "A function is a block of code that can be reused to perform a specific task. This may sound similar to iteration, but functions differ in that they may be called at any time during the program, with different parameters, and instead of running multiple times like a loop, they only run once for every time that you call them.\n",

    "type()\n",

    "\n",
    "Built-in functions, like user-defined functions, take in an input and produce an output. The difference is that we do not have to separately define these functions, since they were already written by the creators of Python to solve simple problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you develop larger programs, it is useful to divide a program into user-defined functions. There are several reasons why you should do this:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Sectioning your program into functions allows you to name groups of commands, which makes your program easier to read, understand, and debug.\n",
    "* Functions can make a program smaller by eliminating repetitive code. If you make future changes, you only have to make them in one spot.\n",
    "* Well-designed functions are often useful outside of the program they're written for. Once you write and debug one, you can reuse it in future programs.\n",
