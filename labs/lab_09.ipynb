    "# **Lab 9 — Downloading files from URLs**\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab we will practice downloading files from URLs online and examining their structure using some common Unix command-line tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your deliverable for this lab will be this notebook, with answers to questions completed as requested below. Please rename the notebook from `lab_09.ipynb` to `<last_name>_lab_09.ipynb` prior to submission. Download the completed file by checking its box in the JupyterHub file browser and selecting **Download** from the menu that appears. Submit it to Canvas under the Lab 9 assignment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Start up a new terminal window to use for this lab from JupyterLab via **File $\\rightarrow$ New $\\rightarrow$ Terminal**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Make an empty directory inside of your GEOS636_PAG directory to work in for this lab:\n",
    "\n",
    "`cd ~/GEOS636_PAG`  \n",
    "`mkdir lab_09`  \n",
    "`cd lab_09`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exercise I: Introducing `curl` and `wget`\n",
    "\n",
    "You may have noticed the `curl` command in previous labs, where we've used it to download simple text files from GitHub or other online sources. An excellent introduction to downloading files with `curl` can be found [here](http://www.compciv.org/recipes/cli/downloading-with-curl/). `wget` is a similar command that can also be used to download files — a guide can be found [here](https://www.pair.com/support/kb/paircloud-downloading-files-with-wget/).\n",
    "\n",
    "The commands have very similar syntax, illustrated below. Try these commands in the terminal:\n",
    "```text\n",
    "curl --remote-name https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uafgeoteach/GEOS636_PAG/master/labs/lab_08/file1\n",
    "cat file1\n",
    "\n",
    "wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uafgeoteach/GEOS636_PAG/master/labs/lab_08/file1\n",
    "cat file1\n",
    "```\n",
    "Each command downloads [`file1`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uafgeoteach/GEOS636_PAG/master/labs/lab_08/file1) (follow the link to see the file's location online and its contents) and stores it with the original remote filename (i.e., `file1`). Note that using the remote name is the default for `wget`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, you could also navigate to the online file in your browser, and save it to your computer manually. For example, on Google Chrome with macOS I can right-click and select **Save As...** to save the file. However, then it would not end up on the OpenSARlab server where you would want to run your analysis, but on your machine at home. In addition, `curl` and `wget` are extremely useful for **automating** this process.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "The following is designed to help you understand various options for `curl`. For each of the three commands below, run them in the terminal and, in a **new text cell** below, describe what happens.\n",
    "\n",
    "```text\n",
    "curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uafgeoteach/GEOS636_PAG/master/labs/lab_08/file2\n",
    "\n",
    "curl --remote-name https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uafgeoteach/GEOS636_PAG/master/labs/lab_08/file2\n",
    "\n",
    "curl --output myfile2 https://raw.githubusercontent.com/uafgeoteach/GEOS636_PAG/master/labs/lab_08/file2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note:** If you don't want to keep copy/pasting the long URL, you can assign it to a variable!"

    "The content that you see is the result of a data request. The parameters for the request are included in the body of the URL itself. In this case, you're looking at metadata for seismometers belonging to the Alaska Volcano Observatory (AVO). In particular, the request portion of the URL has the following components:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `network=AV` — select the AVO seismic network, which has code \"AV\"\n",
    "* `channel=BHZ` — this selects only vertical-component broadband seismometer channels, which have code \"BHZ\" (\"Z\" for vertical)\n",
    "* `startbefore=2020-01-01` — only select stations which were operational before the beginning of 2020\n",
    "* `format=text` — print in an easy-to-read format\n",
    "* `level=station` — specifies to only include station information, rather than more detailed information\n",
    "\n",
    "This URL-based request method is a common way to access data from online sources. Try modifying the URL in your browser with a different `startbefore` date and see how the output changes. You can also change the `network` to `AK` to view all of the corresponding stations belonging to the Alaska Earthquake Center, or `AT` to view National Tsunami Warning Center stations. Change `level` to `network` to view just the network-level information.\n",

    "Using `curl` or `wget` along with other tools for examining text files, answer the following questions. Run your commands in the terminal, and **paste them into a new code cell below, along with your answers**.\n",

    "**(a)** How many AV BHZ stations were operational before the beginning of 2020?  \n",
    "**(b)** Which AV BHZ station(s) were operational before November 2005? Where in Alaska are they located?  \n",
    "**(c)** How many total stations are there in the AT network?\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Hints:**\n",
    "> * You may find it necessary to enclose your URL in quotes (`'` or `\"`).\n",
    "> * For **(a)**, `wc -l` might be helpful. Just make sure to account for blank lines / headers at the start / end of the file — `head` and `tail` will be useful here! You may check your answer by opening your output file in the JupyterHub text editor, which offers line numbering...\n",
    "> * For **(c)**, all you need to provide is `network`, `format`, and `level`. Use `level=network` and examine the output."
