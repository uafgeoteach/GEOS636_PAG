    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're going to be manipulating data mathematically within Python, you're almost certainly going to be using **NumPy**, a Python library for numerical computing. Likewise, for reading in CSV or Excel files and keeping them organized, **pandas** is an essential tool. This lab explores these two key Python libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your deliverable for this lab will be this notebook, with **\"deliverables\" completed as requested below**. The \"exercises\" are exploratory and not graded. Please rename the notebook from `lab_05.ipynb` to `<last_name>_lab_05.ipynb` prior to submission. Download the file using **File $\\rightarrow$ Download .ipynb**. Submit it to Canvas under the Lab 5 assignment **no later than midnight Thursday, September 30th**.\n",

    "```python\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "```\n",
    "which imports the NumPy library with name `np`. Then we access functions of NumPy using, for example, `np.sqrt()` for the square root function, or `np.mean()` for the mean. Here are links for some common commands:\n",

    "* [Statistics](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/routines.statistics.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "For any of the commands listed above, you can run them by writing `np.command_name_here()`. Try out the following code. If any function is unclear, find the documentation at one of the two links in the list above. Note also the handy `np.min()` and `np.max()` functions."
