    "This lab will introduce lists, which are a great way of organizing data. We will also look at flow control and iteration — two essential tools within Python (and other programming languages). Finally, we will calculate statistics on some time series data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your deliverable for this lab will be this notebook, with **\"deliverables\" completed as requested below**. The \"exercises\" are exploratory and not graded. Please rename the notebook from `lab_03.ipynb` to `<last_name>_lab_03.ipynb` prior to submission. Download the file using **File $\\rightarrow$ Download**. Submit it to Canvas under the Lab 3 assignment **no later than 5pm Thursday, September 21st**.\n",

    "In the last lab, we talked about integers, floats and strings. Today, we're going to introduce a data structure — the list. Lists can store multiple values (potentially of different data types) at once. Try these lines in the code cell below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "mylist = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "mylist\n",
    "mylist[0]\n",
    "mylist[0] + 100\n",
    "mylist[0] + mylist[1] + mylist[2]\n",
    "mylist[0] = mylist[1] + mylist[2]\n",
    "mylist  # Remember, entering a variable and nothing else prints the variable if the code cell is run\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also make lists containing different data types and make lists inside of lists (these are called nested lists). Try these lines:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "mylist = [77, 'geophysics', 88.5]\n",
    "type(mylist)\n",
    "type(mylist[0])\n",
    "type(mylist[1])\n",
    "type(mylist[2])\n",
    "mylist[0] + mylist[2]\n",
    "nestedlist = [5, 6, [7, 8, 9, 10], 11, [12, 13]]\n",
    "nestedlist[0]\n",
    "nestedlist[2]\n",
    "nestedlist[2][1]\n",

    "To demonstrate that you understand these list operations, you'll write some code which accesses items within a nested list. The line of code you will use to create your list is displayed below. (Note: it would be easier to copy and paste this code than type it out.) This is a list with entries (which are also lists) containing GPS station name strings and (lon, lat) coordinates. Note that all the brackets here are important, but the formatting is such that it's easier to see which opening and closing brackets go together, so hopefully you can see the structure - in this case none of the formatting affects Python's interpreation of the code, but making it easier to read is important for the human looking at the code.\n",

    "We recently introduced comparison operators. For example, if we defined `x = 5` and then typed `x > 3`, then the program would return `True`. These comparisons can be used in conditional statements to control the flow of the program. In most programming languages, these take the form of `if — else` statements, which are the same thing as the diamond shaped conditionals in the flow charts. Try the code below several times with both positive and negative values for `var`. Additionally, try using the code without indentation to see what happens. Blank space often matters in Python."

    "One of the most useful tools in programming is the ability to automate repetitive tasks. If, for example, we needed to perform hundreds of similar tasks, we can use a \"loop\" to execute these tasks with a few lines of code instead of typing out everything individually. Python provides two kinds of loops - `for` and `while` loops:\n",

Your job is to use flow control to determine which station(s) are contained within the bounding box specified by `LATMIN`, `LATMAX`, `LONMIN`, `LONMAX`. Your code should check for each station in the list whether it is located within the bounding box. If the station is within the bounding box, your code should print the station name. Note that iteration can also help here! To answer this question **add code to the code cell below**. (There are several ways to solve this problem.
