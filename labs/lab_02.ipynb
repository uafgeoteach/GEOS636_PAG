    "In this first exercise we're going to learn how to create variables. Variables are reserved memory locations to store values which can be referenced and manipulated by a computer program. You can think of a variable as a box that you put things in. The box has a name that you have to use in order to see or change what is in the box. We're going to make a variable named `test_var` and print its value. The code cell uses a Python built-in fuction named `print` - you'll learn more about functions in Lab 4. For now just use the code cell below as a template for how to use `print` in your own code cells later on."
