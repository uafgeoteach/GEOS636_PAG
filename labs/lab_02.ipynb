Please rename the notebook from `lab_02.ipynb` to `<last_name>_lab_02.ipynb` prior to submission. Download the file using **File $\\rightarrow$ Download .ipynb**. Submit it to Canvas as a .ipynb file under the Lab 2 assignment **no later than midnight Thursday, September 9th**.\n",

    "In this first exercise we're going to learn how to create variables, make comparisons, and use operators. Variables are reserved memory locations to store values which can be referenced and manipulated by a computer program. We're going to reference `test_var`, compare it to several numeric values and assign it a new value. Then, we'll play with operators.\n",
