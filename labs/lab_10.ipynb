    "In this lab we will practice using `awk`, `grep`, and `sed` command line tools. These tools all share a common function: Text processing.\n",

    "Your deliverable for this lab will be this notebook, with answers to questions completed as requested below. Please rename the notebook from `lab_10.ipynb` to `<last_name>_lab_10.ipynb` prior to submission. Download the completed file by checking its box in the JupyterHub file browser and selecting **Download** from the menu that appears. Submit it to Canvas as a zip file, **along with your output plots for Task 2**, under the Lab 10 assignment.\n",

    "We will work with the file called [`event_list.txt`](http://www.grapenthin.org/teaching/geop501/download/lab10/event_list.txt) (list of earthquakes in October 2017 around the world) for these basic exercises in Task 1. Use `curl -O \"http://www.grapenthin.org/teaching/geop501/download/lab10/event_list.txt\"` to download `event_list.txt`. You can use `head` to examine the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use awk to select specific columns from the file, and change the character separating them. In the original file the fields are separated by commas, the following awk command will pull out the depth and the magnitude of each event and change the separator between them to a colon. Try it out in the terminal. Can you instead change the field separator to a semicolon? You'll need to wrap your semicolon in single quotes, so bash doesn't interpret it as the end of a command.\n",
