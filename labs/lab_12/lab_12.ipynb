    "# Lab 12 — GMT Part 1\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "Today's lab will start with an introduction to environment management and then cover some of the PyGMT [Py Generic Mapping Tools (PyGMT)](https://www.pygmt.org/latest/overview.html) concepts discussed in lecture. You will start with a sample script for a map of Alaska, make simple maps for your research area, and then move on to adding data to maps.\n",
    "\n",
    "PyGMT has a fairly steep learning curve because of the vast number of options available to you to control figures. PyGMT is derived from GMT, which is a command line tool for building maps. Luckily, PyGMT is much easier to work with because it has Python's forgiving syntax rules (no errors because there is an extra space somewhere!). \n",
    "\n",
    "## Helpful resources\n",
    "To get started I would recommend reading through [Making your first Figure](https://www.pygmt.org/latest/get_started/01_first_figure.html#sphx-glr-get-started-01-first-figure-py). This shows you how easy it can be to make a simple figure. To make more complex figures you will want to start by creating a simple version of what you want, and then tweaking the figure and adding features little by little until you have the final product you want. \n",
    "\n",
    "Because of the large number of options available in PyGMT, it is a good idea to get familiar with the [PyGMT documentation](https://www.pygmt.org/latest/api/index.html). Here you can find all of the objects that PyGMT can create, all of the functions you can use on those objects, and all of the arguments that those functions need to run properly.\n",
    "If you aren't sure exactly what you need, taking a look in the [PyGMT Gallery](https://www.pygmt.org/latest/gallery/index.html) might give you a good starting point and some example code.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Deliverables\n",
    "Your deliverable for this lab will be this notebook, with \"deliverables\" completed as requested below. The \"exercises\" are exploratory and not graded. Please rename the notebook from lab_12.ipynb to \\<last_name\\>_lab_12.ipynb prior to submission. Download the file using File  →  Download .ipynb. Submit it to Canvas under the Lab 12 assignment."

    "## Setting up an environment\n",
    "You've completed all of the lab and homework assignments for this class inside of OpenSciencelab (OSL). We do this so that you don't have to deal with installing software on your own computer and so that we don't need to remotely troubleshoot why something won't run on your computer. Once the class is over and you are (we hope!) using the tools you've learned about here for your own projects you'll need to be able to install and manage them on your own machine. This falls under the scope of \"environment management\" and is a common stumbling block for people starting out with Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine the following scenario: you've written your own code that relies on a feature in the newest version of PyGMT and have a script sent to you by a colleague which they wrote a couple years ago that uses old features of PyGMT that do not exist anymore. How can you set up your computer to run both programs? If you install the newest PyGMT version your script will work but the one your colleague sent will not, and vice versa if you install an older PyGMT version. Installing two PyGMT versions is maybe possible but can quickly lead to headache and confusion. The best solution here is to set up different \"environments\" to run each script in. When you set up an environment you start with a clean slate to install whatever you want. Software you install inside of the environment won't affect things outside of the environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several programs that you can use to manage environments, such as [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html), a small version of [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### You don't need to actually do the following steps. They are just for future reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " 1. Start by opening a new terminal with **File > New > Terminal**\n",
    " 2. Run `conda init`\n",
    " 3. Close the terminal you opened and then open a new one\n",
    " 4. Run `/bin/bash`\n",
    " \n",
    "You would use commands that start with `conda` to interact with Miniconda. These first few steps were some housekeeping to set your OSL environment up to play with Miniconda. When you run the last command, `/bin/bash`, you are automatically put inside of an environment called `base`. That is what the `(base)` at the beginning of your terminal prompt means. When you install Miniconda (or Anaconda) the `base` environment is created by default. If you want to install new software it is a good idea to create a new environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. `conda create --name map pygmt pandas numpy`\n",
    "\n",
    "This command will take a little while to run, and youll need to type `y` and hit enter at one point. When it finishes you'll have created a new environment named \"map\" with a few libraries installed in it (along with Python). Lets break down what you just ran. The first part, `conda create`, is the command to create a new environment. `--name map` specifies the name of the environment. `pygmt pandas numpy` are the libraries you want to be installed in this environment. Miniconda will install the most recent versions of each library along with the newest version of Python that all of the specified libraries will work with. You could ask for specific versions if you wanted, by modifying the command to read `pygmt=0.2.0` to get an old version of PyGMT, for example. \n",
    "\n",
    "6. `conda activate map`\n",
    "\n",
    "This will \"activate\" or put you enside of the environment you've just made named `map`\n",
    "\n",
    "7. `which python`\n",
    "\n",
    "`which` is a bash command that shows you the full path to the command you are running (i.e. where it lives on your computer). Running `which python` inside of the map environment will return `/opt/conda/envs/map/bin/python`, showing that the Python you are using when the `map` environment is activated is the one installed when you created the map environment (notice the `envs/map` part of the path - you just created that directory).\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Run `conda deactivate`\n",
    "\n",
    "This command \"deactivates\" or removes you from the environment you are currently in, which was the `map` environment. Since we were in the `base` environment earlier we'll be taken back to that. \n",
    "\n",
    "9. `which python`\n",
    "\n",
    "This will return a different path than the `which python` you ran inside of the `map` environment - this is the path to the Python program that the `base` environment uses.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this exercise was to demonstrate how environments work with a small example. Miniconda and other environment managers are very complex tools, but usually the basic usage is pretty straightforward. Here is a link to the Miniconda/Anaconda [getting started page](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/stable/user-guide/getting-started.html#) if you'd like to learn more.\n"

    "Now that you are experts in creating simple maps, you will now gain experience adding additional information to them. The ability to add additional data to the plots is incredibly useful — you can think about this as layering more and more information to the underlying basemap that you already created.
