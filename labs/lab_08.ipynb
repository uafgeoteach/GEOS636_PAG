    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Unix and shell scripting are very useful tools that can work alongside your developing Python knowledge. In this lab you will exercise some of the commands we discussed in lecture, gain experience with using/understanding the help pages for other commands, and write some simple shell scripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your deliverable for this lab will be this notebook, with answers to questions completed as requested below. Please rename the notebook from `lab_08.ipynb` to `<last_name>_lab_08.ipynb` prior to submission. Download the completed file by checking its box in the JupyterHub file browser and selecting **Download** from the menu that appears. Submit it to Canvas under the Lab 8 assignment **no later than midnight Thursday, October 21nd**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Start up a new terminal window to use for this lab from JupyterHub via **New $\\rightarrow$ Terminal**.\n",

    "## 0 — Gather necessary files using Git\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's gather the files we'll be working with today. In your terminal window, enter\n",
    "```\n",
    "pwd\n",
    "```\n",
    "which will **p**rint the **w**orking **d**irectory. You should see\n",
    "```\n",
    "/home/jovyan\n",
    "```\n",
    "as the output. (If you see anything else, type `cd`, which will move you to the above directory.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we will download the files needed for this lab. We'll do this using [Git](https://git-scm.com/). Git is a powerful tool for \"version control\" — managing different versions of code files. Here, we're going to use it to connect with our class repository which is on GitHub [here](https://github.com/uafgeoteach/GEOS636_PAG). Run the command\n",
    "```\n",
    "git clone https://github.com/uafgeoteach/GEOS636_PAG.git\n",
    "```\n",
    "This command downloads all of the files in the the class GitHub repository and places them in a directory called `GEOS636_PAG`. You can move into this lab's directory (which is within `GEOS636_PAG`) with\n",
    "```\n",
    "cd GEOS636_PAG/labs/lab_08\n",
    "```\n",
    "and you can view the files contained in this directory with\n",
    "```\n",
    "ls\n",
    "```\n",
    "You should see a few files (e.g., `file1`, `file2`) listed in the output. Now you're located in the correct directory with the correct files, and you can begin the lab.\n",

    "## 1 — Unix command scavenger hunt\n",

    "Use the following commands to accomplish the tasks indicated:\n",
    "\n",
    "**(a)** `mkdir` — make a new directory called `tiny_snek`  \n",
    "**(b)** `touch` — create a new file unless it already exists  \n",
    "**(c)** `date` — print out the current date and time in seconds since 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC  \n",
    "**(d)** `cat` — put contents of `file1` and `file2` sequentially together into a new file `file3`  \n",
    "**(e)** `split` — break a 500-line file (`largefile.txt`) into multiple files that each have 50 lines  \n",
    "**(f)** `head` — print out the first 15 lines of the file `largefile2.txt`\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note that this exercise requires that you read the help documentation (or use Google)! To view the help for a command, use\n",
    "> ```\n",

    "\n",
    "**(b)** Write down 1 line of Unix commands that allows you to view the first 20 lines of file `lab8_station_list.txt` (station_name latitude longitude) and pipe the output of this into another command that can count the lines and show that, indeed, we have 20 lines.\n",
