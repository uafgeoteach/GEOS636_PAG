    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Today's lab will use some of the more complex options in PyGMT we've discussed in lecture. You'll be layering different datasets to create a map showing several things. Each deliverable in this lab builds on the last - your final map should be the product of all four deliverables. We've provided an example output of Deliverable 4 for reference in the lab_13 directory. Please note that your map does not need to look exactly like this, you are free to use your preferred projection and color scales as long as they are reasonable.\n",
    "\n",
    "For reference — PyGMT documentation is available [here](https://www.pygmt.org/). You may also want to reference the command line GMT documentation pages [here](https://docs.generic-mapping-tools.org/latest/modules.html). Use these regularly to explore the functions you'll need and see examples of their use.\n",

    "## Submission\n",

    "Please submit your completed notebook on Canvas under the Lab 13 assignment page."

    "For this deliverable, use the PyGMT [`load_earth_relief`](https://www.pygmt.org/latest/api/generated/pygmt.datasets.load_earth_relief.html) function to download bathymetry and topography for the Bering Sea region at 1 minute resolution. Then plot it on a map with shading, a frame, an appropriate color map, shorelines, and the title \"Lab 13 Map\". Use an appropriate projection. The map should extend from 160 to 220 degrees longitude and from 50 to 70 degrees latitude. The comments in the cell below are the PyGMT functions you'll need to complete this deliverable."

    "In this section, you will work with data contained in a data table which you will need to plot in GMT. The data in this case is latitude, longitude, and depth (km) for the position of the subducted slab which forms the Aleutian trench. The source of the data is the [USGS Slab2 model for the Alaska region](https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/5aa2c535e4b0b1c392ea3ca2). We've provided the file, `alu_slab2_dep_02.23.18.xyz`, in the `lab_13` directory. Your task here is to use tools in GMT to convert this data to a grid format and plot the top of the subducted slab — that is, the depth to the slab surface — on your map from Deliverable 1 with 30% transparency, an appropriate colormap, and a labeled color scalebar. You can use the same figure handle you set up in Deliverable 1 to keep adding layers to the same plot. The comments in the cell below are the PyGMT functions you'll need to complete this deliverable."

You can read more about the dataset [here](https://www.ngdc.noaa.gov/mgg/sedthick/). Use [`grdcontour`](https://www.pygmt.org/latest/api/generated/pygmt.Figure.grdcontour.html?highlight=grdcontour#pygmt.Figure.grdcontour) to add sediment thickness contours to your plot from Deliverable 2.
